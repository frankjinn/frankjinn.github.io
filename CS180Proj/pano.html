            <h2>Project 4: Stitching and Panoramics</h2>
            <p>
              In this project I continue to use keypoint matching to transform
              images in interesting ways. This project focuses on stitching
              multiple images together forming a single panoramic image.
            </p>
          </header>

          <h3>Step 1: Recovering Homographies</h3>
          <p>
            The first step in the stitching process is to compute the transform
            between the point-correspondances we manually define. We have to
            solve for 8 degrees of freedom so to get a solution we need 4
            points. However, defining exactly 4 points may lead to a poor
            transform if there is noise. Hence we can define more than 4 points
            to mitigate the effect of noise. However, this leads us to a
            over-constrained solution. We can solve this by using least squares
            to solve for the variables we need.
          </p>

          <p>
            After solving, we can use this the transformation matrix to
            transform our image so that the keypoints line up with one another.
            In this step, I noticed that keypoints that are more spread out in
            the image tend to work better than clustered keypoints, the edges of
            the images where keypoints were clustered would be warped out of
            shape. I suspect this is because when doing least squares, clustered
            keypoints are much more effected by noise even when taking multiple
            samples since a small variation will cause large changes. I imagine
            this to be like trying to line up two pieces of paper use the
            corners versus using a box inside the paper. Obviously lining up the
            paper's corners will product much accurate results.
          </p>

          <p>
            This method, however, left some bright lines between the transformed
            triangles. I believe this is due to the transformation overlapping
            the triangles together at random locations, since the pixles are
            brighter intensity but the correct hue. This resulted in it being
            very difficult to debug, in the future, another method like direct
            pixle interpolation may provide better results.
          </p>

          <p>
            After the warp has been calculated, I warp the image corners. Since
            some of them may end up as negative coordinates, I pad and shift the
            image that I am alligning to. Then using the shifted warped corners,
            I create a mask by drawing a filled polygon using the PIL library.
            This shifted mask is used to specify the coordinates to fill
            relative to the
            <strong style="font-weight: 900">padded image</strong>. The mask is
            then unshifted to find the coordinates to fill relative to the
            <strong style="font-weight: 900">original image</strong>, these
            points are then put through the interpolator to calculate the values
            for each pixel. The pixle values are then applied according to the
            shifted mask.

          <p>
            Finally with the setup being done, we can go onto shifting some
            images. First off is rectifying images. This was not too bad, as we
            just have to manually define the rectangular points we want our
            subject to warp into, and make a dummy second image (a zero value
            image in my case). However, due to only having 4 points and the
            large skew of some of the images, warping the corners would
            sometimes give extremely large coordinate values. The work around
            for this was to just crop the image to be as close to the subject as
            possible, therefore minimizing the coordinates of the warped
            corners. I also tried warping something with text on it to see if
            the text could be read after warping. The result was that the text
            could be read, however, with a camera with better depth of view I
            believe the results would be better.

          <p>
            It is a relatively easy transition to go from this, to stitching
            images together. Its here where I ran into the issue with the
            point-correspondances clustering problem. In the example below, you
            see that objects on the edges of the stitch do not line up properly
            even with blending on overlaps due to most of the points defined
            being in near the monitor area. Another issue is that due to the
            camera autoadjusting contrast, brightness, etc, the edges of the two
            frames become very obvious, so its apparent a better blending method
            is needed.

            <strong style="font-weight: 900">(Bell and Whistle?)</strong>
            coordinates and made sure to pick an image where more points could
            be determined on the edges. Even here, the wires and the sky were
            not ideal since they didnt have many identifiable features.

            As you can see the x-coord blending works much better, and the

            blending, however due to the way pixels values are set, it makes it
            difficult to calculate a smooth scaling array for both the x and y
            directions.

        <h3>Harris Corners</h3>
        <p>
          The first step of the process is to try to identify potential points
          of interest on the image. These would be things such as corners, since
          it lends itself to be more easily localized (as opposed to lines or
          surfaces). We use the Harris corner algorithm which computes the sum
          of products of gradient around a image patch, then using its
          eigenvalues to determine if its a line, edge, or surface. If both
          eigenvalues are small, then its probably a surface, if one is small --
          a line, if both are large -- a corner. The result is a large set of
          potential interest points, which we need to further filter down.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may see that no points are being picked at the very edge of the
          image. This is important when we create feature descriptors, as points
          on the edge would create very poor feature descriptors.

        <h3>Adaptive non-maximal suppression</h3>
        <p>
          One method of filtering could be just taking the strongest corners in
          the list of Harris corners we obtained. However, this often leads to
          clusters of points, which would result in our homography to be very
          sensitive to noise. Instead we employ a technique called "Adaptive
          Non-maximal Suppression", which spreads out the interest points much
          better. In theory how this algorithm works is that it finds the
          smallest radius for each point, where another point in that radius has
          a significantly stronger corner. Then the points we use are the ones
          with the largest radius. This way we ensure a more even spread of
          points, and more points on weaker areas, less points on stronger
          areas. This helps with computing homography, as more points on weaker
          areas helps average out a good homography and makes it less sensitive
          to noise.

        <h3>Keypoint Matching</h3>
        <p>
          Now that we have our interest points on both images, we need a way to
          figure out correspondances. In other words, which pairs of points are
          on the same location on each image? To do this we first need a way to
          compare the area that the point is on. We can use a 8x8 descriptor
          sampled from a 40x40 box around each point. It is important each point
          is only sampled once to avoid aliasing. Another way to think about
          this process is that we are convolving an area with a mask, where the
          stride is the size of the mask. In this case we are convlving a 40x40
          area with a 5x5 mask, with stride 5. This gives a blurred image that
          approximates the area around the point. Given two of these descriptors
          we can check how similar they are and decide if they are describing
          the same point.

          We can push the points of one image through a nearest-neighbor model
          and then find the nearest-neighbor of the points of the second
          picture. Here we use the Lowes rule to find points which have a fit
          that is much better than the rest. The ratio I used is 0.75, meaning
          the ratio of nn1/nn2 is less than 0.75. Using a higher ratio of 0.85
          gave me mostly true positive values, although there were still a few
          false positives, but made alignment worse later on. Looking at their
          descriptors we can see why the model may have thought these points
          were similar.

          Another filtering step is done to both elimate outliers seen in the
          image above. This is done by RANSAC, where 4 points are randomly
          selected, their homography is calculated, and applied to the other
          points. If the resulting point is within a certain distance of the
          actual point (in this case I used 1 pixle), then it is an inlier,
          otherwise it is an outlier. After repreating this process a number of
          times, or until a certain percentage of points become inliers, we
          stop, and calculate the overall homography of all inliers. This
          elimates a few points and gives us the following result.

          This is suprising as most of the image is featureless grass, and I had
